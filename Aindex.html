        <h2>Welcome to LAPD</h2>
        <p>The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) is the police department of the City of Los Angeles, California. With 9,974 officers and 3,036 civilian staff, it is the third-largest municipal police department in the United States, after the New York City Police Department and the Chicago Police Department. The department serves an area of 498 square miles (1,290 km2) and a population of 4,000,000 people.</p>
        <p>The LAPD has been fictionalized in numerous movies, novels, and television shows throughout its history. The department has also been associated with a number of controversies, mainly concerned with racial animosity, police brutality, and police corruption. However, the department has made significant efforts to address these issues and improve community relations in recent years.</p>
